## Hello!
I'm a student currently studying for computer science, network administration and distributed systems.
This is my educational GitHub account, so projects relating to my studies will be published here.

For inquiries regarding my work, refer to my e-mail address, I generally do not respond to commits or pull requests on GitHub as my work is not open-source, only source-available.
